# Inital Step

1. install the following packages:
   - pip3 install flask
   - pip3 install flask-sqlalachemy
   - pip3 install flask-login

## Information and background in flask

- when you create a folder called website (where all the code files are) this becomes a package (folder)
- **init**.py is a file that initalizes the web app
- main.py is the file that runs the web app
- routes.py is the file that defines the routes (links to other pages)
- templates folder is where all the html files will be stored
- models.py is where all the database models (schema) will be stored
- auth.py is where all the authentication code will be stored
- hashing function, a fucntion that does not have an inverse for itself (secure)
  - can generate the same y with x, however, cannot go back to x from y

## Jinja tips

- {% %} is used to define a block of code (for loops, if statements, etc)
- {% block <variable_name> %}...{% endblock %}, block is used when you want children to override the parents template using var defined
- {{ }} some python expression that will be evaluated and can be used to pass in variables
- {% extends "base.html"%}, use base.html as ur base template and override blocks
- {% if ...%}...{% elif ... %}...{% else %}...{% endif %}, this is how you write a if statement
- basic http methods (requests made on page load or a action)
  - Get: on page load, or retrieving information
  - Post: some change to a db or change to state of website/system (sign in or sign up)
