# Inital Step

1. install the following packages:
   - pip3 install flask
   - pip3 install flask-sqlalachemy
   - pip3 install flask-login

## Information and background in flask

- when you create a folder called website (where all the code files are) this becomes a package (folder)
- **init**.py is a file that initalizes the web app
- main.py is the file that runs the web app
- routes.py is the file that defines the routes (links to other pages)
- templates folder is where all the html files will be stored
- models.py is where all the database code will be stored
- auth.py is where all the authentication code will be stored

## Jinja tips

- {% %} is used to define a block of code (for loops, if statements, etc)
- {% block <variable_name> %}...{% endblock %}, block is used when you want children to override the parents template using var defined
- {{ }} some python expression that will be evaluated
- {% extends "base.html"%}, use base.html as ur base template and override blocks
